# Ogem

Ogem is a proxy that allows seamless access to the latest models from OpenAI, Google AI Studio, and Vertex AI using a unified OpenAI-compatible API. You can interact with various models using a single, unified interface.

## Running Ogem locally

Follow these steps to set up and run Ogem on your machine.

1. Update the `config.yaml` file with the models that you want to use.

1. Start the proxy server by running this command from the repository root:

   ```bash
   OPEN_GEMINI_API_KEY=<your_gemini_api_key> \
   GENAI_STUDIO_API_KEY=<your_genai_studio_api_key> \
   GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=<your_google_cloud_project_id> \
   OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_openai_api_key> \
   CLAUDE_API_KEY=<your_claude_api_key> \
   go run main.go
   ```

   Replace placeholders with your actual API keys and values.

Once Ogem is running locally, you can send requests to it, as shown in the example below:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer OGEM_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gemini-1.5-flash",
    "messages": [
      {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
      {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, how are you?"}
    ]
  }'
```

3. If you run Ogem as a single instance, you do not have to use Valkey.

1. If you run Ogem as a cluster, you need to set up Valkey and provide the endpoint to the `VALKEY_ENDPOINT` environment variable. Check [https://valkey.io/](https://valkey.io/) for details.
